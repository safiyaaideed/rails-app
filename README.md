#  Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.
In 2019, it was estimated that the sneaker resale market was valued at around 6 billion U.S. dollars globally. There is a very high demand when it comes to rare and limited edition sneakers. This particular marketplace was built so that it is easier for anyone who wants to buy sneakers online for a cheaper price. Most sneaker resell stores upsell the sneakers by almost triple their worth when they are more rare and limited items. This marketplace (Sole-Mate) strives to give the best prices available.

# 	Why is it a problem that needs solving?

The main issue is accessibility, to put it simply it is difficult to find limited edition sneakers at a good price, Sole-Mate lets you resell your own brand new or used shoes at a few clicks of a button. Sneaker resale is a massive market and it is still very difficult to have access to a lot of shoes because of the limited stock a lot of marketplaces provide. Sole-Mate lets anyone sell their new and used authentic sneakers.

# Explain the different high-level components (abstractions) in your app

The web app is built on Rails and is based on the Model-View-Controller architecture. This pattern allows developers to create complex web apps that are easily built and maintainable. The MVC pattern is a popular architectural pattern when building CRUD applications. This web application consists of routes, views, controllers and models. In this application Routes are used to direct the the requests to the controller which then take the data and returns it to the user which is what they view in the browser. The models represent the database tables and are used to load data, in this case there is a user model category and items model.


# Detail any third party services that your app will use

The third party applications used in the development of this web application were Bootstrap, a CSS framework with ready to use templates for the use of web applications, heroku which is a cloud platform used to manage and deploy applications in an easy way that makes them production ready. The ruby gems used were .env, Rolify for authorisation, simple form for log in an devise for authentication. 

# Describe your projects models in terms of the relationships (active record associations) they have with each other

The types of association rails has are the following:

The belongs_to Association
The has_one Association
The has_many Association
The has_many :through Association
The has_one :through Association
The has_and_belongs_to_many Association

The user has many products and those products belong to the one user, eg. The user can upload many different sneakers but all of those sneakers belong to the one user and are accessible/editable by the one user. 

Here is the code that supports that the user has many products and the products belong to one user.
